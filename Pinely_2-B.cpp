thoughts:
    this one i didn't do the classic no read question, i accually got to the conclution pretty quick!
process:
    so if there is a number x and the number x+1 has already been seen before
    because every switch won't change the relative order of the number EXCEPT for the one you choose
    so just count the number of x+1 you've seen before x is seen.
