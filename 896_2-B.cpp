/*
process:
I saw and had a thought that this was a greedy solution
i started to think how would a plane go the lowest money
there were 4 cases a_big b_big, a_small b_big, a_big b_small, a_small b_small
the both big is just 0
the one small one big is the closest big city to small city
the two small could either be small -> big -> big -> small or small -> small and get the min
then as i wrote the code I found out that i could just check the distance of the towns to all the big citys
and since if the start/end city is in big itself then it would be 0
but i got wrong once bc I didn't think that the ans would be bigger than INT_MAX
changed that bigget and AC
