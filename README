So this is the place I will keep track of all my Codeforces Accepted code
the files name goes as follows (*special_*round_div-numb.cpp)
Special is if the name is not just /Codeforces Round/

I will add when I wrote the code, and the difficulty on the top of the file
                                            |->(some files might not have this)
if I have time I will add my thought process on the bottem of the file

thats it! hope you learn some stuff or gain motivation by watching me suffer through the ranks
